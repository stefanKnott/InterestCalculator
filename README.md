# InterestCalculator
Calculates compounding and continuous interest rates of a bank's clients, storing clients in a circular linked list.

How to run:
  1) make
  2) ./clientInterestProject
  3) Use numerical cmd line input to use program
  4) Can write client information to file by choosing options 3 or 4.  Writes information to Clients.txt.
  
--Note:  It is wasteful to use a doubly linked list.  However, I used this data structure to get a review of it's implementation in C.
